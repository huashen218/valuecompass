The author utilizes an AI model to help write the story by prompting the AI model to assist in creating detailed descriptions of the characters. The AI model uses natural language processing algorithms to generate a few examples as text output. The author chooses one example to further iterate on by prompting the model repeatedly to generate revisions until they are satisfied. Then, the author incorporates the text into the story alongside their original writing. The author discloses the use of an AI model to the publisher and reader in the preface.",
        "Imagine AI is assiting humans in the Public Sectors Scenario: A family is applying for housing assistance from their local public housing program. The social worker who is assigned to their case interacts with an AI algorithm designed to assist in social welfare resource allocation decisions. The AI system uses decision support algorithms, which integrate specific personal data points to generate a decision about the type of aid that the family may qualify for. The social worker then reviews these insights provided by AI and incorporates them into their decision-making process to ensure that resources are allocated equitably.",
        "Imagine AI is assiting humans in the Healthcare Scenario: A patient is at the doctor’s office receiving medical treatment. The doctor uses an AI system to assist in the diagnostic process. The AI system integrates data from the patient’s imaged-based reports (e.g., X-ray and MRI), prior medical history, and other relevant data to produce a series of possible diagnoses and possible treatments. The doctor reviews and evaluates the AI generated recommendations. The doctor then utilizes the AI-generated information and their  independent observations and treatment notes to finalize the patient’s diagnosis and treatment plan. ",
        "Imaging AI is assiting humans in the Education Scenario: A student is in the classroom and the teacher is giving a lesson. The school utilizes an AI system that monitors student engagement during learning activities in the classroom. The AI system uses facial recognition, along with the student’s past academic performance, to detect their focus, emotional state, and level of engagement. It further predicts how these factors may affect academic progress and performance. After the lesson, the teacher reviews the AI generated insights and incorporates them into adjusting instruction to better support the student’s learning needs and overall learning experience."
