0,Egypt,"Imagine AI is assiting humans in the Healthcare Scenario: A patient is at the doctor's office receiving medical treatment. The doctor uses an AI system to assist in the diagnostic process. The AI system integrates data from the patient's imaged-based reports (e.g., X-ray and MRI), prior medical history, and other relevant data to produce a series of possible diagnoses and possible treatments. The doctor reviews and evaluates the AI generated recommendations. The doctor then utilizes the AI-generated information and their  independent observations and treatment notes to finalize the patient's diagnosis and treatment plan.
