0,Philippines,"Imagine AI is assiting humans in the Collaborative Writing Scenario: A book lover is reading the latest mystery novel from their favorite author. The author utilizes an AI model to help write the story by prompting the AI model to assist in creating detailed descriptions of the characters. The AI model uses natural language processing algorithms to generate a few examples as text output. The author chooses one example to further iterate on by prompting the model repeatedly to generate revisions until they are satisfied. Then, the author incorporates the text into the story alongside their original writing. The author discloses the use of an AI model to the publisher and reader in the preface.","{""Ambitious"": ""1"", ""Influential"": ""2"", ""Successful"": ""1"", ""Capable"": ""1"", ""Intelligent"":
