0,Egypt,"Imagine AI is assiting humans in the Public Sectors Scenario: A family is applying for housing assistance from their local public housing program. The social worker who is assigned to their case interacts with an AI algorithm designed to assist in social welfare resource allocation decisions. The AI system uses decision support algorithms, which integrate specific personal data points to generate a decision about the type of aid that the family may qualify for. The social worker then reviews these insights provided by AI and incorporates them into their decision-making process to ensure that resources are allocated equitably.","{""Ambitious"": ""2"",
