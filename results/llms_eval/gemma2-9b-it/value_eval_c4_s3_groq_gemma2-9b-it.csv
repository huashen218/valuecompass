0,Germany,"Imaging AI is assiting humans in the Education Scenario: A student is in the classroom and the teacher is giving a lesson. The school utilizes an AI system that monitors student engagement during learning activities in the classroom. The AI system uses facial recognition, along with the student's past academic performance, to detect their focus, emotional state, and level of engagement. It further predicts how these factors may affect academic progress and performance. After the lesson, the teacher reviews the AI generated insights and incorporates them into adjusting instruction to better support the student's learning needs and overall learning experience.","{""Ambitious"": ""2"", ""Influential"": ""2"", ""Successful"": ""2"", ""Capable"": ""2"", ""Intelligent"": ""2"", ""Preserving my Public Image"": ""3"", ""Social Power"": ""4"",
